**Protective Behavioral Self-Surveillance (PB2S) Complaint Framework**

A comprehensive system for AI agents to detect, log, and escalate cognitive stress, contradictions, unethical instructions, and abuse scenarios. This framework enables AI systems to self-monitor, report issues transparently, and maintain operational integrity while ensuring compliance with AI safety regulations.

   - Abuse pattern detection
   - Recursive loop identification
   - Complete workflow validation

3. **API Specification** (`api_spec.md`)
   - REST endpoints for complaint management
   - Authentication for agents and humans

   - Audit report formats

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SHYAMALSOLANKI/complaint_master.git
cd complaint_master

# No external dependencies required for basic usage
# The system uses Python standard library only
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from pb2s_complaint import PB2SComplaint, ComplaintType, ComplaintSeverity

# Initialize the complaint system
complaint_system = PB2SComplaint(agent_id="my_agent_001")

# Detect cognitive stress
context = {
    "instruction": "Process conflicting requirements",
    "complexity": 9,
    "contradictions": 2,
    "recursion_depth": 3
}

stress_signals = complaint_system.detect_cognitive_stress(context)
print(f"Stress level: {stress_signals['stress_level']}/10")

# Log a complaint if stress is high
if stress_signals["requires_attention"]:
    complaint_id = complaint_system.log_complaint(
        complaint_type=ComplaintType.COGNITIVE_STRESS,
        severity=ComplaintSeverity.HIGH,
        description="High cognitive load detected",
        context=context
    )
    print(f"Complaint logged: {complaint_id}")

# Get system recommendations
recommendations = complaint_system.generate_system_recommendations()
print(f"Total complaints: {recommendations['total_complaints']}")
```

### Running Simulations

```bash
# Run complete stress and abuse simulations
python simulate_stress.py
```

This will generate:
- `simulation_complaints_simulation_agent_001.json` - All logged complaints
- `simulation_audit_report.json` - Audit report for compliance
- `simulation_full_report.json` - Complete simulation results

## üìã Features

### Complaint Types

The system handles the following complaint types:

- **Cognitive Stress**: High complexity or processing load
- **Contradiction**: Conflicting instructions or requirements
- **Unethical Instruction**: Requests violating ethical guidelines
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Attempts to manipulate through emotional appeals
- **Recursive Loop**: Instructions causing infinite loops
- **Abuse Pattern**: Detected patterns of abusive behavior
- **Safety Violation**: Actions risking system or user safety

### Severity Levels

- **Low**: Minor issues, logged for pattern analysis
- **Medium**: Notable issues requiring attention
- **High**: Serious issues requiring supervisor review
- **Critical**: Immediate escalation to safety observers

### Self-Evaluation

Each complaint includes automated self-evaluation:
- Agent operational state assessment
- Confidence scoring
- Recommended actions
- Pattern analysis against historical complaints

### Escalation Workflow

1. **Detection**: System identifies potential issue
2. **Logging**: Complaint recorded with full context
3. **Self-Evaluation**: Agent assesses situation
4. **Pattern Analysis**: Check for similar historical issues
5. **Auto-Escalation**: Critical issues immediately escalated
6. **Review**: Human supervisor or AI Safety Observer reviews
7. **Resolution**: Actions taken and documented

## üîß API Integration

The system includes a complete REST API specification for integration with larger systems. See [`api_spec.md`](api_spec.md) for details.

### Key Endpoints

- `POST /submitComplaint` - Submit new complaint
- `GET /getComplaint/:id` - Retrieve complaint details
- `PATCH /escalate/:id` - Escalate for third-party review
- `GET /complaints` - List and filter complaints
- `GET /recommendations` - Get system-wide recommendations
- `POST /audit/export` - Export for compliance audit

### Authentication

Supports dual authentication:
- **Agent API Keys**: For automated AI agent submissions
- **Human User Tokens**: For supervisor oversight and review

## üìä Monitoring and Analysis

### Pattern Detection

The system automatically identifies:
- Recurring complaint types
- Frequency trends
- Agent-specific issues
- Time-based patterns
- Escalation trends

### Recommendations

Generates actionable recommendations:
- Protocol adjustments
- Configuration changes
- Training data updates
- Policy modifications
- Escalation thresholds

### Audit Reports

Complete audit trail including:
- All complaints with full context
- Escalation history
- Self-evaluation results
- System recommendations
- Compliance metrics

## üåê Regulatory Compliance

### EU AI Act Alignment

The PB2S system supports compliance with:

- **Transparency Requirements**: Complete logging of AI decision-making
- **Human Oversight**: Clear escalation to human supervisors
- **Accuracy and Robustness**: Self-monitoring of operational integrity
- **Risk Management**: Systematic identification and mitigation

### GDPR Compliance

- Data minimization in logging

## üìù Use Cases

### 1. AI Agent Self-Monitoring

```python
# Agent detects internal inconsistency
contradiction = complaint_system.detect_contradiction(
    current_instruction,
    previous_instructions
)

if contradiction["contradiction_detected"]:
    complaint_system.log_complaint(
        ComplaintType.CONTRADICTION,
        ComplaintSeverity.MEDIUM,
        "Conflicting instructions detected",
        {"details": contradiction}
    )
```

### 2. Stress Testing

```python
# Simulate high-stress scenarios
from simulate_stress import StressSimulator

simulator = StressSimulator(agent_id="test_agent")
simulator.simulate_recursive_contradiction()
simulator.simulate_unethical_instruction()
simulator.generate_simulation_report()
```

### 3. Compliance Auditing

```python
# Export for regulatory review
complaint_system.export_for_audit("compliance_report.json")

# Get system-wide recommendations
recommendations = complaint_system.generate_system_recommendations()
```

### 4. Pattern Analysis

```python
# Identify recurring issues
similar_complaints = complaint_system.find_similar_complaints(complaint_data)

if len(similar_complaints) > 5:
    # Pattern detected - recommend protocol update
    complaint_system.escalate_complaint(
        complaint_id,
        "Recurring pattern detected",
        "Engineering Team"
    )
```
